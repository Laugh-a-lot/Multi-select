# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
# Multi-select
You have to design and implement a chip component that looks like below


Specifications
When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear.
As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing.
Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.
Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.
Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.

Bonus Task
Clean code.
TypeScript
When the input is blank and the user presses backspace, the last chip (for example, Nick Giannopoulos) should get highlighted and on again pressing backspace it should get deleted

Notes
Make sure you code your solution in React (CRA/NextJS).
Make sure you build the component from scratch and do not use any component based library like MUI, Chakra UI etc.
You are free to use CSS solutions like TailwindCss/SCSS.
